Getting started with Ansible
-----------------------------
Ansible automates the management of remote systems and controls their desired state. A basic Ansible environment has three main components:

Control node
A system on which Ansible is installed. You run Ansible commands such as ansible or ansible-inventory on a control node.

Managed node
A remote system, or host, that Ansible controls.

Inventory
A list of managed nodes that are logically organized. You create an inventory on the control node to describe host deployments to Ansible.
